Hi Brad,

Using the attached circuit, you could make any combination of AM/FM tones summed together.  To send a DC from a Tone component ('turn off' the AM or FM), you can set it's amp to 0 and set it's shift to the desired DC.  The software just needs to send the appropriate parameters for each signal path.  In most cases it will send 0's to the channels that are not used.

It is easy to add more possible signals or to add a set of noise components/filters that have Tones controlling the parameters (with parameter tags controlling the sine parameters).

By summing all the signal paths together by default the software then has full control over what is playing out.

Regards,
Mark
