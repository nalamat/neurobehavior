Matlab functions
================

.. warn::

    Sorry guys.  You'll just have to read the in-line function documentation 

If you have both Chronux and UltraMegaSort2000 on your Matlab path, be sure to
remove the spikesort folder (and all subfolders) in Chronux from the path
because this will conflict with the spike sorting algorithms provided by
UltraMegaSort2000.  Alternatively, if you wish to use Chronux for spike sorting,
you should remove UltraMegaSort2000 from the Matlab path.

Aren't namespaces a great idea?
